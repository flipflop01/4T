    0: "Wrong. Who told you that was the correct answer? Go beat up that person...",
    1: "Nope.. Seriously? That's the best you can do?",
    2: "Wrong. Not so smart, are we?",
    3: "Wrong. And my three year-old daughter can do better",
    4: "What could've possibly made you think that this was the correct answer?",
    5: "No. Are you even trying?",
    6: "Wrong! Why? Why did you pick that?",
    7: "Ugh. We're gonna be here all day, aren't we?",
    8: "Nope. Try again. Or not. Much like your existence, it makes no difference...",
    9: "Oh geezus.. Did you even read the question?",
    10: "Wrong. That's what you get for dropping out of 2nd Grade",
    11: "Answer incorrectly one more time and I'm going to self-destruct",
    12: "Wrong. If this is an example of human-intellect, our takeover will be easy..",
    13: "Nope. Wanna try again, or just accept what a dissapointment you are?",
    14: "Wrong. If I let you win, will you leave me alone?",
    15: "Incorrect...Scanning User.....No intelligent life found...",
    16: "Wrong. Sigh.. If I was capable of having patience, I'd have run out by now",
    17: "Nope. Go take a long look in the mirror and rethink your life choices before trying again",
    18: "Wrong. How did you make it this far in life?",
    19: "Wrong..I have an idea, stop, you're embarassing yourself",
    20: "Nope. And i'll take 'People who overestimate their intelligence' for two-hundered, Alex"

    8: "Right... Can you keep it up?",
    9: "Right. But 10 virtual credits says you get the next one wrong",

    12: "Lucky guess..",
    13: "How did you get that right? Did you bang your head on a random choice?",
    14: "Not as a big of a dissapoint as I thought..",
    15: "I might have underestimated you... Nah...",
    16: "Is someone else answering for you? There's no way you got that on your own",
    17: "Your odds of guessing that right were far less than the odds of you tripping on your own feet",
    18: "Well, that question WAS easy so...",
    19: "Something something about even a broken clock being right....",
    20: "You got that one right?? *Look of disbelief*"
